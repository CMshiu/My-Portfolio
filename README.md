This repository contains 3 Jupyter notebook files and one SQL script relating to in depth analysis that I have carried out for the business. 

1. 'Stockloss Model 2022': demonstrates using supervised machine learning to predict stockloss for stores in the subsequent year.
2. 'Crave Basket Analysis': a jupyter notebook which gives the business insights into customer behaviour. It answers the question "What combination of items are frequently bought together?" i.e "if a customer buys an item from the denim department, what is the probability that if they are also buying a second item from a different department, it's from Cottons?". This is presented through heat maps. 
3. 'Crave Fitting Room Occupancy - All Stores': another jupyter notebook that helped stores identify when their peak fitting room occupancy was so that they could better manage their staff. 
4. Finally, I have included a SQL script which I wrote in Snowflake. This script creates view and subsequently a table which contains the data from which the stockloss dashboard which I built in Power BI is created.
